# BMI Calculator Project Report

## Introduction
This report provides an overview of the Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator project, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The BMI Calculator is a web-based tool designed to calculate an individual's BMI based on their height and weight.

## Functionality
The BMI Calculator functions by taking user input for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) and then applying the BMI formula:

\[ BMI = \frac{weight(kg)}{height(m)^2} \]

The calculated BMI is then used to categorize the individual's health status (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity). The result is dynamically displayed on the webpage along with a corresponding description.

## Key Components

### 1. HTML (index.html)
The HTML file defines the structure of the web page. It contains input fields for weight and height, a button to trigger the BMI calculation, and areas to display the BMI result and its description.

### 2. CSS (style.css)
The CSS file provides the styling rules for the webpage. It sets the layout, color schemes, fonts, and other visual elements. The styling is crucial for creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

### 3. JavaScript (script.js)
The JavaScript file contains the logic for calculating the BMI based on user input. It retrieves the values entered by the user, performs the BMI calculation, and updates the result on the webpage dynamically. Additionally, it categorizes the BMI result and provides a corresponding description.

## Code Attribution
The project was developed with reference to the tutorial video titled ["Creating a BMI Calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBYqkpsafyI). The video provided valuable insights and guidance throughout the development process.

## Conclusion
The BMI Calculator project showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and interactive web application. It serves as a useful tool for individuals to assess their BMI and gain insights into their overall health status.
